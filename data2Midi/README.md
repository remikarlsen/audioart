# Data To MIDI

**Imports and processes CSV data**

Requires: https://github.com/cirlabs/miditime

* Imports CSV data
* Normalises the data
* Creates MIDI using Miditime lib with custom conf

TODO:
* Check out the log algorithm mentioned in within the comments,
perhaps that makes the cut of 100 is not necessary
* BPM doesn't seem to have any effect when sent as param to MIDITime
